# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
Requirement Analysis is a **critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of a software product.  
This ensures that all stakeholders have a **clear and mutual understanding** of what the system should do and how it should perform.

The purpose of this repository is to **document the processes, methodologies, and best practices** for performing requirement analysis in software development projects.  
It will serve as a **reference guide** for developers, designers, project managers, and other stakeholders involved in defining system requirements.
